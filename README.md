# Hi There! ðŸ‘‹
I am DylDev. I am just an everyday high-school student who really enjoys coding. Specifically in Python. I only work on one project and that is Euro truck Simulator 2 Lane Assist, which will keep the truck inside of the lane in Euro Truck Simulator 2. You can find more about the project and what i've done here:
