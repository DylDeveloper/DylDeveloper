# Hi There ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Dylan, I am a software developer (and sometimes a web developer) in high school with the dream of becoming one. Alot of my free time is spent developing software such as Euro Truck Simulator 2 Lane Assist. I am really into machine learning, AI, and robotics.

I compete on a FIRST Robotics team, previously participated in the GA FLL State Championship. Also working on a couple of custom robots.

# Languages
I know several languages, The only language i am currently fluent in is Python, some I'm almost good at, like Typescript, Bash, and Powerscript, and some I have dipped in a little bit like, C, GDScript, and Kotlin
Im always open to learn more languages and get better at languages I already know.
