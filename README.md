# Hi There ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Dylan, I am a software developer in high school with the dream of becoming one. Alot of my free time is spent developing software such as Euro Truck Simulator 2 Lane Assist. I am really into machine learning, AI, and robotics.

I compete on a FIRST Robotics FTC team, Georgia FTC Super Regional champion. I am also custom making a robot called the Lawnzilla which is an autonomous robotic lawn mower.

I got into software development just over a year ago, and I hope my journey continues.

# Languages
I know several languages, some I am experienced in, like Python, some i'm almost good at, like Typescript, Bash, and Powerscript, and some I have dipped in a little bit, like, C, HTML, and Kotlin

Im always open to learn more languages and get better at languages I already know.
